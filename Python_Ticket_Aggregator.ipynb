    "Write a program that gets as input the data on these criteria. The data is entered from the keyboard. Think about the way you organize the input, transform the data, and check whether the data are entered in a right way. Then the program should classify an offer based on these criteria and print on the screen an offer category and this offer's description. You need to come up with the classification rule based on the information from the brief. In principle, the output should be one of the four categories, which are 'the best', 'good enough', 'bad', and 'other' (for those which cannot be classified as either of three main categories).

    "**Advantages**: The aggregator described in the task is **quite simple** and **not overloaded with various parameters**. For the user, this means that everything can be quickly and easily understood. The aggregator is based on the price and the number of transfers, they are **the main important criteria** when choosing a flight for most users.\n",
    "\n",
    "On the other hand, there are a **number of disadvantages**:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The refund and the luggage options are not critical** in the described criterion condition. In practice, the option of having baggage for many users is important, as is the return of the ticket. Based on my experience, I would prioritize the option of having luggage.\n",
    "\n",
    "- In the context of the coronavirus and changing rules, **the option to return a ticket is also becoming a priority**. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **The aggregator does not take into account flight options correctly**. With an increase in the number of transfers, the weight of the ticket decreases, this is accounted for in the aggregator. But at the same time there is a price fixation for the criterion, which makes the choice inaccurate. For example, in the case of two transfers and a price of $ 150 (that is, the price is not in the range from 200 to 250), the aggregator will classify this case as 'Other', although in practice, due to the number of transfers, the ticket level has worsened, but at the expense of the price is worthy of the 'Good enough' level.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The non-congestion of the system with additional parameters gives the system lightness, but **for a more comfortable flight, most often it is necessary to clarify many points**. Here is a list of the main options that may be important to users: the departure / arrival time, availability of food, availability of the Internet (entertainment service), availability of oversized baggage (especially important in winter during the winter sports season), availability of the option to take a stroller on board (for passengers with children), availability of an option to choose an airport, the waiting time (in case of flights with transfers), etc.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **The aggregator takes into account the fact of the number of transfers, but not their conditions**. The aggregator described in the example is designed mainly for finding a cheap ticket, where the priority is a direct flight. In the case of connecting flights, other parameters take priority. In this case, if the flight has transfers, it makes sence to add the waiting time to considering for a more comfortable flight.\n",
    "\n",
    "**My opinion on these rules**\n",
    "\n",
    "I agree with the pricing policy of the criterion, cheaper tickets, of course, are a priority for me. For correct classification, it is necessary to leave only the upper price limit in the criterion \"Good enough\". Transfers make the ticket less attractive, but in this case the ticket price again plays an important role, but long waiting times must be taken into account. Also, I really do not like very early and very late flights, I take this into account when choosing tickets and I would like to see this option in the aggregator."
